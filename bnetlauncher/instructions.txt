Purpose
-------
This aplication is intended to facilitate the launch of battle.net games from steam with overlay.

Note: If the launcher isn't running when starting the game it will be closed as soon as the game starts,
      otherwise it will be left running.


Howto Use
---------
1. Extract the included exe to any location you want
2. Add the exe to steam as a non-steam game shortcut
3. On the shortcut properties add one of the following codes *they are case sensitive*
	WoW	= World of Warcraft
	D3	= Diablo 3
	WTCG	= Heartstone
	Pro	= Overwatch
	S2	= Starcraft 2
	Hero	= Heroes of the Storm
	
	the result should look something like this:
		"G:\World of Warcraft\bnetlauncher.exe" WoW
