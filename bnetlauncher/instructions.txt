Purpose
-------
This aplication is intended to facilitate the launch of battle.net games from steam with overlay.

Note: If the launcher isn't running when starting the game it will be closed as soon as the game starts,
      otherwise it will be left running.


Howto Use
---------
1. Extract the included exe to any location you want
2. Add the exe to steam as a non-steam game shortcut
3. On the shortcut properties add one of the following codes *they are case sensitive*
	WoW	= World of Warcraft
	D3	= Diablo 3
	WTCG	= Heartstone
	Pro	= Overwatch
	S2	= Starcraft 2
	Hero	= Heroes of the Storm
	
	the result should look something like this:
		"G:\Steam\bnetlauncher.exe" WoW

Optional: In case of problems logging can be enabled by creating a enablelog.txt file inside
          "%localappdata%\madalien.com\bnetlauncher\", you can open the location by pasting the path
		  into explorer or the run dialog in windows (WinKey+R)


Known Issues
-------------
- bnetlauncher does not check invalid game arguments so it will just error out after 15s when not detecting
  a running game
- It's not possible to launch PTR versions of games, bnetlauncher uses battle.net client uri handler to
  start the games, which does not support the PTR versions. I have not found a proper workaround for this.
- If more then 3 battle.net games are started at the same time some of them will not be auto logged in, this 
  seems to be a limitation with the battle.net client.
- Users of the 1.5 beta series will need to delete the "%localappdata%\madalien.com\Battle.net Launcher for Steam"
  directory by hand.
- There's no built in routine to clean up the log files if they pile up (logging is disabled by default)
- On close battle.net client will leave a "ghost" tray icon after being closed by bnetlauncher
- Running bnetlauncher as administrator will break steam overlay if steam is not also run as administrator

Requirements
------------
Windows 7 or above (Only really tested on Windows 10)
.Net Framework 4.5  (included by default in Windows 8 or above) or better.
